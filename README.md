# CloudStorage

Client-server application, written using IO on client-side and Netty on server-side.
Transfer files realized using serialization (as a simple way to write code for transfer files).
Because of this fact application doesn't support transfer large files.
Source code was decorated using recommendations of Java Code Convenience.
